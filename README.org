Tools to help converting my various CSV outputs from bank accounts and credit
cards into a ledger file.  There are (or will be) a few components:
- Sanitising the CSV files from the banks/credit cards I use,
- Command-line interface for easily selecting the correct account for each
  transaction (for this I implemented something like ido-mode in Python),
- Machine learning to automatically predict the account for each transaction,
- Consolidation of ledger files from various accounts (for inter-account
  transfers).

* Installation
Requires Python >= 3.6. Scripts assume the interpreter is called
~python~. Install the requirements with pip:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

* Converting one CSV to ledger format
Use ~accounts.py~. Only three parameters are required, the others are for
using training data to enable prediction:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
usage: accounts.py [-h] [-t TRAINING_DATA] [-n NEW_TRAINING_DATA_OUTPUT]
                   [-c CURRENCY]
                   csv_file account_name ledger_output

Makes ledger from CSV file semi-automatically. If training data is provided
then a model is trained and used to predict classes.

positional arguments:
  csv_file              CSV file containing date, payee, and amount (relative
                        to this account).
  account_name          Name of this account.
  ledger_output         Output Ledger file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TRAINING_DATA, --training_data TRAINING_DATA
                        CSV file containing training data of form
                        payee_string,account_name (default: None)
  -n NEW_TRAINING_DATA_OUTPUT, --new_training_data_output NEW_TRAINING_DATA_OUTPUT
                        File to write new training data generated during this
                        session. (default: None)
  -c CURRENCY, --currency CURRENCY
                        Currency symbol to use. (default: Â£)
#+END_QUOTE

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./accounts.py -t accumulation/training/Current-201710.csv \
                -n output/training/Current-201711.csv \
                ~/bank/natwest-current/Current-20180503-split/Current-201711.csv \
                Assets:Natwest:Current \
                output/ledger/Current-201711.ledger
#+END_SRC

* Testing the model
Run ~model.py~ to show how the model performs on a 3-fold validation test, for
example:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./model.py accumulation/training/Current-201711.csv
#+END_SRC
